# CSS Advanced Project

![Project Badge](URL_TO_YOUR_PROJECT_BADGE_IMAGE)

This project is part of your learning journey to become proficient in CSS and responsive web design.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the CSS and styling aspects of the webpage. The goal is to implement the styles and design elements based on the Figma file provided. The designer file is available on Figma, and you can access the final design details by duplicating it to your drafts.

**Important notes with Figma:**

- If your computer doesn't have the required fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](FONT_LINK) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](FONT_LINK).
- Some values in the design are in float; feel free to round them as needed.

Before starting the implementation, please ensure that all tasks from the HTML, advanced project have been completed.

## Getting Started

To begin working on this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `styles.css`.
2. Import `styles.css` in the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
```

## Task List

### 1. Header and Banner (10 points)

Based on the Figma file, add the correct styling to the header and the first section of the page. Ensure that all color values, widths, heights, and images match the Figma design. Keep your CSS simple and clean, and use straightforward CSS selectors to achieve the desired styling.

### 2. Quotes (5 points)

Style the quote section based on the Figma design. Start to centralize your style and CSS selectors to create a consistent look across the page.

### 3. Videos List (9 points)

Add the correct styling to the videos list section, ensuring that it matches the design in the Figma file.

### 4. Membership (6 points)

Style the membership section to match the design in the Figma file.

### 6. Footer (6 points)
